## ⚠️ Identified Vulnerabilities (2 MEDIUM SEVERITY)

### 1. Content Security Policy - Unsafe Inline (MEDIUM)
- **Issue:** CSP configuration uses 'unsafe-inline' for scripts and styles
- **Risk:** Reduces effectiveness against certain XSS attacks
- **Impact:** Medium - Compatibility vs. security tradeoff
- **Recommendation:** Remove 'unsafe-inline' where possible, use nonces or hashes

### 2. Command Injection Prevention (MEDIUM)
- **Issue:** Command injection prevention only 44.4% effective
- **Risk:** Some command injection patterns may bypass filters
- **Impact:** Medium - Limited command execution context
- **Recommendation:** Enhance input validation patterns for command injection vectors

---

### Immediate Actions (Optional - System is Production Ready)
1. **Enhance Command Injection Prevention**
   - Add more comprehensive command injection detection patterns
   - Consider whitelist-based validation for system commands
   
2. **CSP Optimization**
   - Gradually remove 'unsafe-inline' from CSP
   - Implement nonces for dynamic content where needed

### Future Enhancements
1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**
   - Consider implementing MFA for admin access
   - Add hardware token support for high-security environments

2. **Advanced Threat Detection**
