Safety Assessments
Comprehensive machine safety assessments to identify hazards, evaluate risks, and define safety requirements for your equipment.


Hazard Identification: Pinpoint potential dangers from moving parts, energy sources, or operational processes.

Risk Assessment: Evaluate the likelihood and severity of potential incidents to prioritize safety measures.

Safety Requirements Specification: Define the necessary safeguards, including emergency stops, interlocks, light curtains, and protective devices.

Performance Level Determination: Assign appropriate Performance Levels (PL) to safety functions in line with ISO 13849 and IEC 62061. 




Safety System Design
Engineering and specifying comprehensive machine safety systems to protect personnel, prevent hazards, and ensure compliance with ISO 13849 and IEC 62061.


Safety Circuit & PLC Design: Develop fail-safe control circuits and program safety logic for machinery, including emergency stops and interlocks.

Physical Safeguards: Design and integrate safety cages, barriers, and enclosures to prevent access to hazardous areas.

Emergency Stop Systems: Implement reliable mechanisms to halt equipment instantly in unsafe conditions.

Light Curtain & Sensor Integration: Install electro-sensitive protective devices to safeguard access points without disrupting workflow.
